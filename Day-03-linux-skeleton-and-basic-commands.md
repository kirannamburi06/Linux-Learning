# Day 3: Skeleton of Linux and Basic Commands

Hello everyone.

In this post, I am going to write about the basic skeleton of a Linux system and some basic Linux commands.
By skeleton, I mean the basic directory structure of Linux and why those directories exist.

Understanding this is very important, because in Linux everything is organized in a specific way, and once you understand this structure, Linux starts to make sense.

---

## Linux Filesystem Skeleton

Linux follows a standard filesystem hierarchy.

Everything in Linux starts from the root directory, which is represented by `/`.

Unlike Windows, Linux does not have drives like C:, D:, etc.
All files and directories are organized under `/`.

---

## Important Directories and Their Purpose

### `/`

This is the root of the filesystem.
Every file and directory in Linux exists under this directory.

---

### `/bin`

This directory contains essential binary executables.

These are basic commands required for the system to work, even in single-user mode.

Examples:

- ls
- cp
- mv
- rm
- cat

These commands are available for all users.

---

### `/sbin`

This directory contains system binaries.

These are mostly administrative commands used by the root user.

Examples:

- ip
- mount
- reboot
- shutdown

Normal users usually do not need these commands.

---

### `/etc`

This directory contains configuration files.

Almost every service or application stores its configuration here.

Examples:

- /etc/passwd – user information
- /etc/group – group information
- /etc/hostname – system hostname
- /etc/systemd/ – systemd configuration

In Linux, configuration is mostly done by editing text files.

---

### `/home`

This directory contains home directories of users.

Each user has a separate directory inside `/home`.

Example:

- /home/kiran

User-specific files, downloads, documents, and settings are stored here.

---

### `/root`

This is the home directory of the root user.

It is different from `/home/root`.

---

### `/var`

This directory contains variable data.

These files change frequently while the system is running.

Examples:

- /var/log – system logs
- /var/cache – cache files
- /var/spool – print jobs, mail queues

---

### `/tmp`

This directory contains temporary files.

Files here are usually deleted automatically after reboot.

Applications use this directory for temporary storage.

---

### `/usr`

This directory contains user applications and libraries.

It includes:

- /usr/bin – user commands
- /usr/lib – libraries
- /usr/share – shared data

Most installed applications reside here.

---

### `/lib`

This directory contains shared libraries required by binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.

Without these libraries, basic commands will not work.

---

### `/proc`

This is a virtual filesystem, not a real directory on disk.

It provides information about:

- running processes
- kernel
- system memory
- CPU

Examples:

- /proc/cpuinfo
- /proc/meminfo

These files are generated by the kernel.

---

### `/dev`

This directory contains device files.

In Linux, hardware devices are represented as files.

Examples:

- /dev/sda
- /dev/null
- /dev/tty

This follows the idea that everything in Linux is a file.

---

## Basic Linux Commands

Now let us look at some basic commands that are used frequently.

---

### `pwd`

Prints the present working directory.

```bash
pwd
```

---

### `ls`

Lists files and directories.

```bash
ls
ls -l
ls -a
```

---

### `cd`

Used to change directory.

```bash
cd /etc
cd ..
cd ~
```

---

### `mkdir`

Creates a directory.

```bash
mkdir test
mkdir -p dir1/dir2
```

---

### `touch`

Creates an empty file.

```bash
touch file.txt
```

---

### `cp`

Copies files or directories.

```bash
cp file1 file2
cp -r dir1 dir2
```

---

### `mv`

Moves or renames files.

```bash
mv file1 file2
mv file /tmp
```

---

### `rm`

Deletes files or directories.

```bash
rm file
rm -r dir
```

This command is dangerous if used incorrectly.

---

### `cat`

Displays file content.

```bash
cat file.txt
```

---

### `less`

Used to view large files.

```bash
less file.txt
```

Press `q` to quit.

---

### `man`

Displays the manual page of a command.

```bash
man ls
```

This is one of the most important commands.
